## Working definition of volunteering {.theme-slide2}

- “Activity to the greater benefit of a group of people/the world that one undertakes that is not directly or visibly associated with material rewards”

### Careful: HOPE LABOR

- “Activity that one undertakes in the hope that it will lead to a (significant) reward although this has never been specifically communicated.”
- Is what I am doing volunteering or is it hope labor?

I am not an expert, but I am still here …

Check your motivation

For most people, volunteering is internally motivated

- Does it spark joy?
- Is it fun?
- The way is the goal

Real life example:

- Johanna signs up to create a course on how to create a personal website because she is really interested in it.

2. Find your strengths and easy wins

- What is something that I am really excited about?
- What is something I want to learn?
- What is something that I am really passionate about?

Volunteering can have many faces

Personally, I would recommend to work with people

But volunteering can also be:

- create a YouTube channel and educate the world about your topic 
- Write on a blog
- mentor

Real life example:

- Johanna agrees to organize an AI day on campus because she is interested in the topic.

3 Maximize your returns

* Talk about it: Visibility

* Blog posts

* CV

* Recommendations/Networking

* Community

* Make it fun

Real life example:

  - Johanna uses a new tool (that she is really exited about) to create a web based slideshow for her talk at MRI together
  - Johanna upload all your work to Zenodo and get a DOI to make it citable
  - Johanna also gets a DOI for the github repo the talk lives in

## Volunteering {.theme-slide2 .scrollable}

4. Share wins and work in a community

- Working together reduced the load
- Working together is more fun
- Working together broadens your network and your horizon

Real life example:

- Johanna really enjoys [book dash weeks at the Turing Institute](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/bookdash.html)

## Volunteering {.theme-slide2 .scrollable}

5. Minimize friction and losses

- If an engagement does not fit in your life anymore, it can be paused - and re-activated if fit
- Communicate your feelings/life with your community

Real life example:

- Johanna paused a lot of her activities in the two months before she moved back from Australia to Europe.

6 Take care of yourself

- It’s a marathon, not a sprint
- Set boundaries
- Make yourself heard

Real life example:

- Johanna has a headache from  looking at the screen all day and cancels all her evening meetings to go to bed.
- Johanna prioritizes her running & exercise and the well-being of her cat

7. Reflect

- Have regularly schedule thought sessions on your past experiences
- Be proud of yourself
- Adjust your future volunteering practices

- Share time zone load
- Focus on projects with a sustainable outcome 
  + Open Science 


## CHALLENGES AND REWARDS {.theme-section1 .center}

## CHALLENGES {.theme-slide3 .scrollable}

- Living in Australia made it REALLY HARD to contribute internationally
- Sometimes, people are not willing to share the time zone load
- Often, volunteering happens after a day’s work
  + If you’re lucky, during “borrowed time” (time that you need to make up for)
  + 9-5 vs 5-9 
- Sometimes, volunteering adds to the list of deadlines
- Hard to prioritize
- Requires some good organisation skills 

## REWARDS {.theme-slide3 .scrollable}

- I have learned A LOT and volunteering has boosted my career
- Visibility
- Sometimes, physical and monetary (gifts)
- Communities (!!) and Networks
    + OLS, the Turing Way
- Collaborations
- Opportunities
- Friends ...


## ACTUAL RESULTS {.theme-slide3 .scrollable}
- Papers published in JOSS
- Chapters in the Turing way
- AI day at campus 
- A [Git course](https://git-course.netlify.app/)
- Brainhack global each year
- Podcasts
- 5 mentees ...
